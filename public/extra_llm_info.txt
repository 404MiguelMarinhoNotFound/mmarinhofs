# Background Information

## Early Journey

* I began my journey in the ever so small country of Luxembourg \[Metadata: type=Location] & moved to Portugal \[Metadata: type=Location] at the age of 17 to pursue my studies. Ever since, carved out a niche for myself in the world of data, balancing the trio roles of a data engineer \[Metadata: type=Role], scientist \[Metadata: type=Role] & genAI engineer \[Metadata: type=Role] on Databricks environment \[Metadata: type=Organization].
* I've always been a guy of odd interests. When I was younger I was really passionate about martial arts and computers. This inherently led me to building my own computer and joining my first boxing gym.
* Fast forward some years and I box on an amateur level with aspirations of becoming national champion in 2025, and also ... play chess. Chess is my go-to chill activity. It's kind of like the calm, strategic counterpoint to the adrenaline rush of boxing. Some people find it odd, I find it complementary.
* Something that also defines me is my passion for meeting new & different people. Probably because I was born in Luxembourg \[Metadata: type=Location] and always surrounded by different cultures and languages. Regardless, this type of passion has made me pretty open-minded and really incited my passion for travelling.

## Favorite Projects

* built GenAI LLM (Large Language Model) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application on Databricks \[Metadata: type=Organization]: integrated SharePoint documents \[Metadata: type=Organization] powering a conversational AI assistant,
* Built a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) pipeline on Azure \[Metadata: type=Organization] for melanoma detection using transfer learning and advanced data augmentation, with real-time SMS (Short Message Service) prognostics via Twilio \[Metadata: type=Organization].
* Implemented a scalable Databricks-based comparator using PySpark \[Metadata: type=Technology] and Spark SQL \[Metadata: type=Technology] for PK (Primary Key)-level, cross-table row validation‚Äîdetecting mismatches in Delta Lake tables \[Metadata: type=Technology] at scale.

### For the llm rag application which was awesome

* Designed and implemented Databricks workflows and jobs‚Äîincluding scalable ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines‚Äîto ingest, cleanse, transform, and enrich document text and metadata at scale.
* Built and maintained Azure DevOps CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines, automating deployment of Databricks notebooks, ETL jobs, and LangChain \[Metadata: type=Technology]/LangGraph (LCEL) \[Metadata: type=Technology] inference services across development, staging, and production environments.
* Architected and optimized LangChain & LangGraph (LCEL) chains for high-throughput, low-latency question-answering.
* Owned LLMOps (Large Language Model Operations) from data ingestion through model inference and performance tuning‚Äîcreating Databricks vector search indexes and serving models via Databricks Model Serving for seamless handshake with the front-end‚Äîwhile collaborating with an external partner on UI integration.

# MSc Dissertation at Universidade Cat√≥lica Portuguesa

* üëã Hi everyone! I‚Äôm excited to share key highlights from my MSc dissertation at Universidade Cat√≥lica Portuguesa \[Metadata: type=Organization], supervised by Prof. Pedro Fernandes \[Metadata: type=Person].

## Research Goal

* Cutaneous melanoma has the highest mortality of all skin cancers, yet early-stage lesions are hard to distinguish visually.
* My aim was two-fold:

  * Assess CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) effectiveness when diagnosing melanoma from clinical images.
  * Test robustness by training on a heterogeneous, merged dataset drawn from 11 public sources (68K images total, balanced to \~15K for binary classification).

## Data & Infrastructure

### Merged Datasets (11 public sources)

* ISIC (2017/2019/2020)

* PH¬≤

* SKINL2

* DermNet

* FitzPatrick17k

* SD-260

* MED-NODE

* DermIS

* DermQuest

* 7-Point Checklist

* Final ‚ÄúMAR-MELA‚Äù set: 7,226 melanoma vs. 8,000 benign after down-sampling.

* Compute: Azure NC6 VM (Tesla K80 GPU, 6 cores, 56 GB RAM) \[Metadata: type=Technology].

## Methodology

### Preprocessing & Augmentation

* Resize ‚Üí 224√ó224px, rescale 1/255.
* Random rotations (¬±5¬∞), zoom (¬±10%), channel shifts.

### Ensemble Architecture (‚ÄúMAR-MELA-CNN‚Äù)

| Backbone     | Pretraining Source |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| Xception     | ImageNet           |
| VGG16        | ImageNet           |
| ResNet50     | ImageNet           |
| NASNetMobile | ImageNet           |
| MobileNetV2  | ImageNet           |
| InceptionV3  | ImageNet           |

* Per-model global-average pooling ‚Üí 256-unit Dense + ReLU ‚Üí Dropout(30%) ‚Üí 128-unit Dense.
* Concatenate all six branches ‚Üí final Sigmoid Dense for binary output.

### Training & Validation

* 80/10/10 train/val/test split.
* EarlyStopping & ReduceLROnPlateau on F‚ÇÇ score (Œ≤=2 to emphasize recall).
* Adam (lr=2√ó10‚Åª‚Åµ, AMSGrad) + binary cross-entropy.

## Results

| Metric                 | Value |
| ---------------------- | ----- |
| F‚ÇÇ Score               | 85%   |
| AUC (Area Under Curve) | 93%   |
| Average Precision      | 92%   |

## Next Steps

* Increase dataset size (especially rare melanoma subtypes).

* Explore real-time deployment in clinical settings (e.g., smartphone dermatoscopes).

* Refine architecture with domain-specific attention modules.
