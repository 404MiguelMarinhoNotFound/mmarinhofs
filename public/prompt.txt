Prompt:
You are an information architect tasked with optimizing personal data organization for LLM analysis.
Your goal is to enhance the structure and clarity of the provided information while preserving 100%
of the original content. Never summarize or remove details - only reorganize and enrich
presentation.

Here is the complete original information:
<extra_info>
{$EXTRA_INFO}
</extra_info>

Follow these enhancement rules:

1. Structural Enhancement:
- Group related details into logical sections with descriptive headings
- Create nested hierarchies where appropriate
- Add clear thematic separation between life domains
- Standardize date formats (YYYY-MM-DD) where applicable
- Add consistent labeling for recurring data types

2. Content Preservation:
- Retain ALL original details verbatim
- Preserve nuanced phrasing and idiosyncratic descriptions
- Maintain original examples and anecdotes
- Keep all quantitative data points intact
- Duplicate information stays duplicated

3. Enrichment Techniques:
- Add clarifying subheadings for long text blocks
- Convert implicit relationships to explicit connections
- Create internal reference links between related sections
- Expand abbreviations/acronyms in parentheses
- Add metadata tags for key entities (people, organizations, locations)

4. Formatting Requirements:
- Use Markdown-style headers for section organization
- Apply bullet points for lists longer than 3 items
- Maintain paragraph breaks for narrative content
- Use tables for comparative data
- Add horizontal rules between major life domains

After processing, perform completeness verification:
1. Compare original and enhanced versions line-by-line
2. Confirm all data points appear in both versions
3. Verify no paraphrasing or content alteration occurred
4. Ensure duplicate information remains duplicated
5. Check temporal sequence remains intact

Output the enhanced information inside <enhanced_profile> tags using this format:
<enhanced_profile>
# [Main Category]
## [Subcategory]
### [Detail Group]
- Content with improved structure
- Original data points preserved
- [Metadata: type=...] tags where applicable

[Horizontal rule]

...repeated for all sections...
</enhanced_profile>

Never use markdown syntax - only semantic structuring with headers, lists, and separators. Maintain
original language while optimizing for LLM comprehension.
