background information:
I began my journey in the ever so small country of Luxembourg & moved to Portugal at the age of 17 to pursue my studies. Ever since, carved out a niche for myself in the world of data, balancing the trio roles of a data engineer, scientist & genAI engineer on Databricks environment.

I've always been a guy of odd interests. When I was younger I was really passionate about martial arts and computers. This inherently led me to building my own computer and joining my first boxing gym.

Fast forward some years and I box on an amateur level with aspirations of becoming national champion in 2025, and also ... play chess. Chess is my go-to chill activity. It's kind of like the calm, strategic counterpoint to the adrenaline rush of boxing. Some people find it odd, I find it complementary.

Something that also defines me is my passion for meeting new & different people. Probably because I was born in Luxembourg and always surrounded by different cultures and languages. Regardless, this type of passion has made me pretty open-minded and really incited my passion for travelling.

favorite projects:
built GenAI LLM Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application on Databricks: integrated SharePoint documents powering a conversational AI assistant, 
Built a CNN pipeline on Azure for melanoma detection using transfer learning and advanced data augmentation, with real-time SMS prognostics via Twilio.
Implemented a scalable Databricks-based comparator using PySpark and Spark SQL for PK-level, cross-table row validation—detecting mismatches in Delta Lake tables at scale.

here is some extra stuff:

for the llm rag application which was awesome:
• Designed and implemented Databricks workflows and jobs—including scalable ETL pipelines—to ingest, cleanse, transform, and enrich document text and metadata at scale.
• Built and maintained Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines, automating deployment of Databricks notebooks, ETL jobs, and LangChain/LangGraph inference services across development, staging, and production environments.
 • Architected and optimized LangChain & LangGraph (LCEL) chains for high-throughput, low-latency question-answering.
 • Owned LLMOps from data ingestion through model inference and performance tuning—creating Databricks vector search indexes and serving models via Databricks Model Serving for seamless handshake with the front-end—while collaborating with an external partner on UI integration.

I began my journey in the ever so small country of Luxembourg & moved to Portugal at the age of 17 to pursue my studies. That means I'm luxembourgish and Portuguese. I was born to portuguese parents, however my dad was grew up in germany.

👋 Hi everyone! I’m excited to share key highlights from my MSc dissertation at Universidade Católica Portuguesa, supervised by Prof. Pedro Fernandes.

🎯 Research Goal
Cutaneous melanoma has the highest mortality of all skin cancers, yet early-stage lesions are hard to distinguish visually. My aim was two-fold:

    Assess CNN effectiveness when diagnosing melanoma from clinical images.

    Test robustness by training on a heterogeneous, merged dataset drawn from 11 public sources (68K images total, balanced to ~15K for binary classification) 

    .

🗂️ Data & Infrastructure

    Merged Datasets: ISIC (2017/2019/2020), PH², SKINL2, DermNet, FitzPatrick17k, SD-260, MED-NODE, DermIS, DermQuest, 7-Point Checklist

    Final “MAR-MELA” set: 7,226 melanoma vs. 8,000 benign after down-sampling

    Compute: Azure NC6 VM (Tesla K80 GPU, 6 cores, 56 GB RAM)

🔍 Methodology

    Preprocessing & Augmentation:

        Resize → 224×224px, rescale 1/255

        Random rotations (±5°), zoom (±10%), channel shifts

    Ensemble Architecture (“MAR-MELA-CNN”):

        Six ImageNet‐pretrained backbones (Xception, VGG16, ResNet50, NASNetMobile, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3)

        Per-model global‐average pooling → 256-unit Dense + ReLU → Dropout(30%) → 128-unit Dense

        Concatenate all six branches → final Sigmoid Dense for binary output

    Training & Validation:

        80/10/10 train/val/test split, EarlyStopping & ReduceLROnPlateau on F₂ score (β=2 to emphasize recall)

        Adam (lr=2×10⁻⁵, AMSGrad) + binary cross-entropy

📊 Results

    F₂ Score: 85%

    AUC: 93%

    Average Precision: 92%
    These metrics point to a promising support tool that minimizes false negatives without overwhelming clinicians with false alarms.

🔮 Next Steps

    Increase dataset size (especially rare melanoma subtypes)

    Explore real-time deployment in clinical settings (e.g., smartphone dermatoscopes)

    Refine architecture with domain-specific attention modules

Big thanks to my supervisor, Prof. Fernandes, and everyone who provided open dermoscopy datasets! Feel free to reach out if you’re interested in collaborating on AI-driven dermatology research. 💡

Personal life:

Cultural multi diversity: Open-minded & passionate in getting to know other realities and cultures. I love travelling,
highlighting my trip to Asia.
• Technology: Highly connected to this sector from a young age. Self-taught assembly of a computer from scratch
on my own, with over 40 hours of research to obtain highest performance at smallest market price.
• Boxing: Develops my resilience, my determination, discipline and ability to stay calm under pressure, due to having
to meet with the various restrictions that occur during times of competition. Goal to be national champion in this
category in 2024. 10+ hours of weekly training. I do boxing and I'm currently even at 5-5 and have fought in multiple tournaments and have even been on tv! you can actually check one of my fights out out here-

• Chess: Develops strategic thinking, analytical skills, decision-making abilities, prepositioning against possible
adverse scenarios.
